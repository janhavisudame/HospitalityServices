- The dashboard tracks the 5 most important Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the hospitality industry to monitor the health of the business.

- RevPar (Revenue per Available Room) is calculated as the total revenue divided by the total available rooms. ADR (Average Daily Rate), on the other hand, is calculated based on total revenue divided by the total rooms actually sold.

- When occupancy reaches 100%, RevPar and ADR become equal.

Tracking Period:

- We can also monitor WoW% (Week-over-Week percentage change) for these metrics.

- This dashboard enables daily and weekly tracking. This is crucial because monitoring metrics on a daily/weekly basis with WoW% changes allows hotels to respond quickly to shifts in demand (e.g., offering last-minute discounts) and make informed decisions on staffing and pricing for improved revenue management.

Weekends vs Weekdays:

- Understanding trends on weekends versus weekdays helps management effectively allocate resources. For example, if there's a decline in weekday metrics, targeted promotions can be offered to business travelers, such as special breakfast packages.

- Additionally, the dashboard provides metrics at both weekday and weekend levels.
